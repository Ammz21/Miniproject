# Driver Detection System 
Driver detection system is a project built using ML algorithms, Dlib and OpenCV with Python as a backend language.
<h3>Logic of project</h3>
Our driver detection system consists of two key phases. Firstly, we employ machine learning algorithms to classify driving behavior based on real-time data analysis. Secondly, we use OpenCV and dlib with 68 landmark detection points to detect driver drowsiness accurately. This two-phase approach ensures comprehensive monitoring and enhances road safety.</br></br>

<h3>The working of the project</h3>

<li>Now we are taking the ratio which is described as <i>'Sum of distances of vertical landmarks divided by twice the distance between horizontal landmarks'</i>.
<li>Now this ratio is totally dependent on your system which you may configure accordingly for the thresholds of sleeping, drowsy, active.</ul>
